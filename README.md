# How to use it
0. If you haven't installed the dependencies above, go do it right now !
1. Download and extract the latest source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/Winenobe/releases)
- Alternatively, you may clone or download the repository. Please be aware that the version on the repo is bleeding edge and might be broken. Don't do this unless you know what you're doing.
2. Open up a terminal emulator. Change the directory to the one that you just downloaded.
3. Run `chmod +x winenobe.sh`
4. Depending on the version you wanted to install, run the following commands:
- `./winenobe.sh 2016` for 2016
- `./winenobe.sh 2012` for 2012
- Run `./winenobe.sh --help` to display additional options.
5. Hit Play on a game and you should be able to join!
# Notes
As of recent tests, I've discovered that the 2012 version actually works ! You just have to hit play a few times until the launcher opens with English text instead of Chinese text.
